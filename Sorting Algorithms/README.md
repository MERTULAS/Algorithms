# Comparison the sorting algorithms

## Insertion Sort

  - ### Is insertion sort fast?
    - #### It's pretty fast for small "n" values.
    - #### Not at all for large "n".


## Selection Sort
  - #### Selection sort is it never makes more than O(n) swaps and can be useful when memory write is a costly operation.


## Shell Sort
  - #### Insertion sort does not perform well when the close elements are far apart. Shell sort helps in reducing the distance between the close elements. Thus, there will be less number of swappings to be performed.


## Bubble Sort
  - #### The primary advantage of the bubble sort is that it is popular and easy to implement. 
  - #### Elements are swapped in place without using additional temporary storage, so the space requirement is at a minimum.
  - #### Not good at large "n" values. As such, the bubble sort is mostly suitable for academic teaching but not for real-life applications.
